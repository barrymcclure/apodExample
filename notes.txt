Add caching...
	key to keep last fetch
	key to keep data object from api

**Plan:
**	use go-redis to attach to a redis server and use it for caching.


Add ability to react to media type within the data.. image or video

select a day, 


learning - 
	docker images...
	docker cross communication   (the main reason for using redis, instead of an internal map for caching)


add logging...
(what are best practices for this?)

the cache 'service' should look in cache, if it is expired or empty it should call a passed in function to 
get the value it is supposed to cache.  once the value is retreived, creat the key and store in redis server.
